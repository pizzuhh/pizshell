# PIZSHELL
pizshell is very basic shell for linux. It can't do much but has some basic functionality
# Building
It's recommended to build it yourself, here's how
1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/pizzuhh/pizshell.git`
2. cd into the folder `cd ./pizshell`
3. run `make` and wait for it to build
4. the app is located in `pizshell-dir/build/pizshell` (or `./build/pizshell`)
5. after the app has been built run `chmod +x /build/pizshell` to make it executable
6. now simply run `/build/pizshell`.
# Note
This is very basic shell and it's not recommended for everyday use.
# TODOs
1. Make so people can add their own commands easily
2. Make better help command and handle command errors
